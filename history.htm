      <h2>The Facts of Our Past </h2>
      <p>The history of the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity began in 1858 at Bethany   College in Bethany, Virginia (now West Virginia). The social life on campus was   typical of the small colleges of the day, with activities centered around the Neotrophian   Society, a literary society. As of 1858 it is believed that at least one   secret group, named Phi Kappa Psi, was operating an attempt to gain control of   the society and its honors.</p>
      <p>From a report given by Jacob S. Lowe in 1859 (as well as others that   were present at the time), a group of students met in the Dowdell boarding house   (in Lowe's room) to discuss actions to retake control of the Neotrophian Society   and return control to the students at large in late 1858. A constitution, name,   badge, ritual and motto were devised, and Delta Tau Delta was born.</p>
      <p>In the early history of the Fraternity, the future of the organization hinged   on the initiation of two men, Rhodes Sutton and Samuel Brown, that required them   to ride from then Jefferson College in Washington/Canonsburg, Pennsylvania   through a terrible rain storm to deliver the Alpha Charter to Ohio Wesslyan   College in an effort to keep the Fraternity alive. Delta Tau Delta now has   one-hundred sixteen undergraduate chapters, six thousand active undergraduates,   and over one-hundred fifteen thousand alumni.</p>

      <h3><a name="timeline" id="timeline"></a>Timeline </h3>
      <p>To understand the history of Delta Tau Delta you must also understand the   founding of greek letter societies. There are many similarities in the founding   of the greek system in 1776 and the founding of Delta Tau Delta in 1858. </p>
      <p><strong>1858</strong> Delta Tau Delta is founded at Bethany College in   Bethany, Virginia (now West Virginia). Eight undergraduates, angered by a fixed   vote for a prize in oratory to be given at the Neotrophian Literary Society &ndash; a   forum for students to practice and demonstrate skills in poetry, public speaking   and writing essays &ndash; respond by forming a secret society. The society is to see   that the Neotrophian is returned to popular control. </p>
      <p><strong>1859</strong> Bethany Chapter grants charters to three chapters: West   Liberty, West Virginia University and Jefferson. To establish membership, the   new chapters are given a Constitution and Ritual, membership badges and are   taught the Fraternity's mottoes and purposes. </p>
      <p><strong>1861</strong> Jefferson Chapter assumes Fraternity control and Alpha   designation. Henry Bell, a founder and alumnus, comes from his home in Kentucky   to search for a way to preserve the Fraternity after the last remaining Bethany   members leave for the armed forces. In Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, at Jefferson   College, he finds Rhodes Sutton and Samuel Brown and persuades them to come to   Bethany to be initiated. The two men brave a snowstorm and nearly impassible   mountain roads on horseback to be initiated at Bethany on February 22. Sutton   and Brown return to Canonsburg the following morning and that day initiate two   more men at Jefferson. </p>
      <p><strong>1866</strong> First General Convention is held in Pittsburgh,   Pennsylvania with five chapters represented: Allegheny, Ohio University,   Washington and Jefferson, Monmouth and Pittsburgh. </p>
      <p><strong>1869</strong> Ohio Wesleyan chapter assumes control of the Fraternity   and takes on the Alpha designation after Jefferson chapter is closed. William H.   Kirk is instrumental in keeping the Fraternity alive. </p>
      <p><strong>1874</strong> Four Divisions of the Fraternity are created, the first   such step taken by any fraternity. </p>
      <p><strong>1875</strong> Allegheny chapter, the fourth and final chapter to hold   Alpha designation, assumes control of the Fraternity after the Ohio Wesleyan   chapter disappears. James S. Eaton, Alpha (Allegheny) 1875, a &ldquo;hero&rdquo; of the   Fraternity, travels to Delaware, Ohio to collect what remains of the   organization&rsquo;s records. Delta Tau Delta flourishes during Allegheny's era of   control; a magazine (The Crescent) is established; 15 chapters are founded, of   which eight survive (several others are reestablished later). </p>
      <p><strong>1880</strong> First alumni chapter is founded in Chicago, Illinois. </p>
      <p><strong>1883</strong> The Executive Council is established to govern the   Fraternity, replacing government by the Alpha Chapter. For the first time,   administration of the Fraternity is passed from undergraduates to alumni   volunteers. The Alpha Chapter, however, makes certain that the annual General   Convention, to which all chapters send representatives, is still the   policymaking body and that the Executive Council&rsquo;s role is to carry out the   decisions made at the General Convention &ndash; later known as Karnea. </p>
      <p><strong>1886</strong> The Fraternity merges with the Rainbow Fraternity, a   Southern fraternity founded in 1848 at the University of Mississippi. </p>
      <p><strong>1889</strong> A new Fraternity Constitution establishes the position   of chapter advisor and changes the name of the Executive Council to Arch   Chapter. </p>
      <p><strong>1909</strong> The National Interfraternity Council is formed by a   group of men&rsquo;s fraternities, including Delta Tau Delta. James B. Curtis, a Delt,   is one of the founders. </p>
      <p><strong>1913</strong> Central Office established in New York City, later   moves to Indianapolis, Indiana. </p>
      <p><strong>1921</strong> Undergraduate Loan Fund established. </p>
      <p><strong>1922</strong> First Field Secretary &ndash; later chapter consultants &ndash; is   appointed. Delta Tau Delta was the first to create such a position in the   fraternity world. </p>
      <p><strong>1924</strong> Delta Tau Delta creates the office of Supervisor of   Scholarship, becoming the first fraternity to place on its governing board an   officer concerned solely with fostering high scholarship. </p>
      <p><strong>1926</strong> The Loyalty Fund, the Fraternity's endowment fund is   established by undergraduates. </p>
      <p><strong>1929</strong> The Distinguished Service Chapter formed to honor Delt   alumni who render outstanding service to the Fraternity. The Delt Creed, written   by Stuart MacLean, Sewanee 1897, officially adopted. </p>
      <p><strong>1934</strong> The first edition of the Chapter Management Guide (now   called the Chapter Leadership Guide) and The Good Delt: His Book, the   Fraternity's first pledge manual, are published. </p>
      <p><strong>1941</strong> Delta Tau Delta Educational Fund is established. </p>
      <p><strong>1956</strong> Centennial Development Fund established to take care of   new chapters, formed during postwar expansion, which had limited funds, no   alumni and faced great difficulty in obtaining adequate housing. </p>
      <p><strong>1958</strong> Delta Tau Delta celebrates its first 100 years at the   Centennial Karnea in Pittsburgh. </p>
      <p><strong>1966</strong> First Hugh Shields Award for Chapter Excellence   announced. </p>
      <p><strong>1967</strong> The President&rsquo;s Council, forerunner of the present   Undergraduate Council, created by Fraternity President and Supreme Court Justice   Tom C. Clark. </p>
      <p><strong>1974</strong> Delta Tau Delta honored by The Newcomen Society in   North America, the first fraternity so recognized. </p>
      <p><strong>1977</strong> The Fraternity restores the Bethany Founding House,   birthplace of Delta Tau Delta. </p>
      <p><strong>1980</strong> The 75th Karnea, meeting in Pittsburgh, makes the   pilgrimage to Bethany for the formal dedication of the Founders' House. </p>
      <p><strong>1981</strong> Educational Foundation of Delta Tau Delta established   as a nonprofit organization to promote educational and charitable activities. </p>
      <p><strong>1986</strong> Delta Tau Delta launches a comprehensive program for   alcohol abuse prevention called &ldquo;Delts Talking About Alcohol.&rdquo; </p>
      <p><strong>1990</strong> The Fraternity adopts the Chapter Responsibility   Guidelines to assist chapters with liability and risk management issues. The   Fraternity begins Delt Insurance and Risk Management Program to give chapters   uniform quality and advice on insurance coverage and risk management. </p>
      <p><strong>1992</strong> The first Delt Leadership Academy is held in Chicago.   The Delta Tau Delta Educational Foundation announces the completion of a $6   million capital campaign. Delt 2000 program launched. </p>
      <p><strong>1993</strong> The Chapter Leadership Guide is developed, replacing   the Chapter Management Guide. Delta Tau Delta Housing Association is   established. </p>

      <p><strong><a name="founders" id="founders"></a>Cameo on Founders </strong><br />
      <a name="Earle" id="Earle"></a><strong>Alexander C. Earle</strong> was the youngest of the eight   founders and went on to become a captain in the Second South Carolina   Volunteers, where he commanded his own company. For many years his whereabouts   were unknown and he was believed dead, but he was located living in Arkansas.   Earles&rsquo; spirit of courage is one we emulate today. He also set an excellent   example for us through his commitment to lifelong learning and growth by   attending three Karneas. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a name="Alfred" id="Alfred"></a><strong>Richard H. Alfred</strong>, at 26 was the oldest of the   group and later became a minister and a physician. His involvement with Delta   Tau Delta stemmed from a sense of moral duty to the truth. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a name="Cunningham" id="Cunningham"></a><strong>William R. Cunningham</strong>, was 25 and only a   freshman at the time Delta Tau Delta was formed. Because he was older and had   become a Mason he exerted much influence in the group. Cunningham was probably   responsible for much of the early language in both the Constitution and Ritual.   He served as President of the Karnea in 1883. He was also a minister and held   public office in the state of Washington. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a name="Hunt" id="Hunt"></a><strong>John L.N. Hunt</strong> was the scholar of the group. After   graduating from Bethany, he became the valedictorian of his class at New York   University&rsquo;s School of Law. He then served for several years as New York&rsquo;s   Commissioner of Education. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a name="Lowe" id="Lowe"></a><strong>Jacob Lowe</strong> hosted the first meetings of the group in   his quarters in a rooming house that has now become a shrine for the Fraternity.   Lowe, who became a professor and later a college president, helped facilitate   the initial bonds of brotherhood. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a name="Tarr" id="Tarr"></a><strong>Eugene Tarr</strong>, a &quot;local boy&quot; whose home was only six   miles from Bethany, stayed in West Virginia after college. A strong proponent of   strengthening his community, he became a noted speaker, lawyer and editor of a   newspaper. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a name="Johnson" id="Johnson"></a><strong>John C. Johnson</strong> was a native West Virginian   (although at that time the area was still a part of Virginia). He became a   lawyer and politician and was the political advisor to John W. Davis, the   Democratic nominee for President in 1924. He outlived the other founders by   eight years. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a name="Bell" id="Bell"></a><strong>Henry K. Bell</strong>, Kentuckian, lived only six years after   graduation but his contribution to the Fraternity was immense. Without him,   there would be no Delta Tau Delta today. Bell responded to a call for help from   the last remaining members of the Bethany chapter who were leaving to join the   armed forces. Bell initiated Rhodes Standbury Sutton and Samuel S. Brown from   Jefferson during a raging snowstorm on February 22, 1861. Upon the collapse of   the Bethany chapter following its members&rsquo; departure, the new Jefferson chapter   took over management of the Fraternity.</p>
